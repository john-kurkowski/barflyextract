      This cocktail wasn't actually named after Scottish poet Robert Burns (1759 - 1796) that doesn't stop the Scottish from  drinking this cocktail to his honor every January 25th during a celebration known as "Burns Night". 
      
      This Scotch Based Riff on a Manhattan (basically a Rob Roy with splash of Benedictine) was first published by Harry Craddock in his Savoy Cocktail book published in 1930. The drink most definitely predates Craddock, and it is possible we'll never know it's true origin. But after Craddock printed it, it definitely became popular as evidenced by it's inclusion in the books: Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Days published in 1931 by Albert Stevens Crocket and again by David A. Embury in his 1948 book The Fine Art Of Mixing Drinks.

      Not only is it officially fall but October is National Applejack Month and we decided to celebrate with five distinctive cocktails to help you ring in the Holiday Season!
      
      Applejack, in short, is American Apple Brandy and it is the first American Distilled Spirit. Some may argue that we were distilling Rum beforehand, but I would argue back that Rum is a product of the Caribbean  and therefore not an American Product. The term Applejack comes from the Colonial method of making Apple Brandy called Jacking, the process of freeze fermenting cider then removing the ice and increasing alcohol content. The Story of Applejack and the story of the Laird's family are intertwined (you'll notice I'm using Laird's Bonded Applejack). Since 1698 something like 12 generations of the Lairds family have been making Applejack in Monmouth County New Jersey (hence it's nickname Jersey Lightning). The first Laird, William landed in New Jersey from Scotland and was believed to be a distiller by trade, when he looked around at available product to distill he landed on apples which were plentiful in the region. The weather and soil wasn't hospitable to Rye, Corn or Barley and Whiskey had not yet begun pouring through the Cumberland Gap, so Apple Cider and then Applejack it was! Today Laird's & Co. is the oldest licensed distillery in the United States and it is still family Run.
